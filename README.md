# odin-recipes

This project is to build a basic recipe website.

Skills involved in this will be basic HTML, including elements such as head, title, h1, body, p, ol, ul, li, and including links and likely images.
More importantly, I am becoming more familiar and comfortable with writing in HTML, and can begin visualizing what the web page will look like.
Perhaps most importantly, I am becoming more comfortable with using git from the command line. Commit messages are still a little weird, but I'm hoping to understand what I'm doing correctly and incorrectly as I continue learning and reviewing.
