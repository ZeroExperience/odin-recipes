                <li>2 additional tbsp canola oil, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 1/4 cup oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, paprika, cumin, and oregano in a large glass or ceramic bowl; mix well. 
                    Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil in batches until tender and browned, about 5 minutes per batch. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
